# Leather 101 — Forth & Vale

**Goal:** help buyers choose the right leather/finish fast.

## Core leather types
- **Full-grain cowhide:** maximum strength and natural character; patinas over time. Premium feel.
- **Top-grain cowhide:** slightly corrected for a more uniform look; great balance of durability and consistency.
- **Veg-tan:** tanned with plant extracts; firmer hand, ages with a warm patina. Ideal for belts, tags, and heritage looks.
- **Chrome-tan:** soft hand, excellent color vibrancy, stable performance; widely used for bags and SLGs.
- **Specialty finishes:** saffiano (cross-hatch & scratch-resistant), pebble emboss, nubuck (buffed surface), pull-up (dynamic tonal shifts).

## Picking the right leather
- **Laptop sleeves & totes:** top-grain or full-grain; semi-aniline or pebble for scuff resistance.
- **Belts:** veg-tan, 3.0–3.5 mm thickness.
- **Card holders & SLGs:** saffiano or top-grain for structure and durability.

## Care & durability
- Avoid prolonged moisture/heat.
- Condition sparingly with a neutral cream suitable for the specific finish.
- Expect natural variations—hallmarks of genuine leather.
