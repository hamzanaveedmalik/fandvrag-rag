question,answer
What leather types do you use?,"We primarily work with full-grain and top-grain cowhide, plus specialty finishes like saffiano, pebble emboss, nubuck, and veg-tan. For each product, the leather type is listed in our catalog."
Are product samples available?,Yes. Most SKUs have samples available. The typical sample fee is listed per item in the catalog and may be credited against a production order—confirm with our team.
How do I request samples?,"Tell the concierge which SKUs, colors, and your shipping country. We'll collect your company name, email, and address and share a secure payment link for the sample fee + shipping."
What are your MOQs?,MOQs vary by product. See the 'moq' column in the catalog. We can sometimes accommodate lower MOQs for pilot programs; ask the team.
What are standard lead times?,Lead times vary by product and queue. See the 'lead_time_days' column for guidance. Exact dates are confirmed in your PI once specs are locked and deposit received.
Do you offer branding (embossing/debossing/foil)?,"Yes. We support blind deboss, foil (gold/silver/black), and custom dies. Share your vector logo (AI/PDF/SVG) and we’ll confirm die size and placement."
Can you match a custom color?,Often yes. Provide a Pantone reference or control sample. Color-match feasibility depends on leather/finish; we’ll confirm after a lab dip.
What about packaging?,"We offer standard dust bags and can produce custom boxes, sleeves, swing tags, and barcodes upon request."
Do you provide design support?,"We can adapt our core patterns and provide dielines for branding. For net-new patterns, our team can quote development time after a brief."
Which markets do you ship to?,"We routinely ship to the UK, EU, and US. Other regions on request."
What are shipping terms?,Common terms are EXW or FOB. DDP may be available to selected destinations. Duties/taxes are per destination rules.
What payment terms do you offer?,"Standard terms are 50% deposit to start production and 50% before dispatch. Alternative terms available for repeat buyers, subject to approval."
Do you handle QC?,Yes. Each batch undergoes in-house QC to AQL standards. Third-party inspections can be arranged upon request.
Can you sign an NDA?,Yes. We regularly work under NDA with private-label clients. Share your template or request ours.
What information do you need to quote?,"SKU and quantity, leather/finish, color, branding method, packaging needs, destination country, target timeline."
What is your returns policy for B2B?,Made-to-order goods are non-returnable except for manufacturing defects. Report issues within 7 days of delivery with photos; we will review and propose a remedy.
How do I book a call?,Ask for a call and the concierge will share our live booking link to choose a slot that suits your timezone.

Do you offer rush production?,Case-by-case. Share your deadline; we’ll confirm feasibility and any surcharge once we review capacity.
