# Sampling & MOQ Policy — Forth & Vale

## Samples
- Samples are available for most items (see catalog column `sample_available`).
- A **sample fee** applies to cover material and setup. Typical ranges are in the catalog; final amount is confirmed before dispatch.
- We can often **credit a portion** of the sample fee against a production order—confirm per project.

## Ordering samples
Provide: SKU(s), color(s), branding method, company details, shipping address, and deadline. We will share a secure payment link and ETA.

## MOQs
- Minimums vary by product and finish (see `moq` in the catalog).
- Pilot runs below MOQ may be possible; timelines and unit economics can change accordingly.

## Timelines
- Typical sample dispatch: **7–14 days** after payment and file approval.
- Production lead times are listed per SKU in the catalog and confirmed in your PI once specs are locked and deposit received.
